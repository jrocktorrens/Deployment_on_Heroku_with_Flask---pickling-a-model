# Heroku Flask - Pickling a Model

This repository serves as a practical example of deploying a machine learning model on Heroku using Flask and pickling. It demonstrates how to push files to a Heroku server and make predictions using a model loaded from a pickle file.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase the steps involved in deploying a machine learning model as a web service on Heroku. It covers the following key aspects:

- **Flask Web Application:** The project includes a Flask-based web application that exposes an API for making predictions with a machine learning model.

- **Model Serialization:** We use the pickle library to serialize a trained machine learning model, making it ready for deployment.

- **Heroku Deployment:** The repository demonstrates how to deploy the Flask application and the pickled model to a Heroku server, making it accessible to the outside world.

## Getting Started

To get started with this example project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone` to clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup Your Environment:** Create a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Train Your Model:** If you have your own machine learning model, you can train it or use an existing one. Serialize the trained model using the pickle library.

4. **Deploy to Heroku:** Follow the provided instructions to deploy the Flask application and model to Heroku.

5. **Access the API:** Once deployed, you can access the API endpoint to make predictions using your machine learning model.

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: The Flask web application code.
- `model.pkl`: The serialized machine learning model (you should replace this with your own model).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
- `Procfile`: Specifies the command to run the Flask app on Heroku.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Further Information

For detailed instructions and additional information about deploying machine learning models on Heroku with Flask and pickling, please refer to the project's documentation and guides.
